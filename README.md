# Aerolinea Factoría F5

## ✅Project Description
The Aerolínea Factoría F5 project is a comprehensive RESTful API designed for managing an airline's operations, including user management, flight scheduling, reservation handling, and destination management. The system incorporates advanced features such as secure authentication using JWT or Basic Auth and ensures flight availability is accurately maintained. The project emphasizes clean architecture and object-oriented programming principles to deliver a robust and maintainable system.

The system guarantees that no bookings can be made for unavailable flights or those exceeding their operational dates.
